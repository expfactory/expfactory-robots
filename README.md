# Experiment Factory Robots

This set of scripts (and provided container) will allow you to run a robot test for various kinds of experiments. Currently supported are surveys and jspsych experiments.  Local (non container) use will be discussed first, followed by Docker.

## Setup

For the examples, we can clone the [test-task](https://www.github.com/expfactory-experiments/test-task) experiment and the [bis11-survey](https://www.github.com/expfactory-experiments/bis11-survey).

```
cd /tmp
git clone https://www.github.com/expfactory-experiments/test-task
git clone https://www.github.com/expfactory-experiments/bis11-survey
```

To test locally, you will need expfactory installed locally.

```
pip install expfactory

# Development
git clone https://www.github.com/expfactory/expfactory
cd expfactory
python setup.py install
```

and for Singularity, you will need to [install Singularity](https://singularityware.github.io/install-linux).


## JsPsych Robot

Note that usage requires python 3, so if you cannot provide it, use the container.

The basic usage is to specify a list of one or more experiment folder paths, and then
optionally select a robot type (the default is jspsych):


```
python start.py --help
usage: start.py [-h] [--robot {survey,jspsych}] folders [folders ...]

expfactory: generate survey from config.json and question file

positional arguments:
  folders               experiments for robot testing

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --robot {survey,jspsych}, -r {survey,jspsych}
                        the survey robot to recruit!
  --browser {Firefox,Chrome}, -b {Firefox,Chrome}
                        browser driver to use for the robot
```

To run the robot for the test-task and use jspsych, we can simply do:

```
python start.py /tmp/test-task
```

This would be equivalent to:


```
python start.py --robot jspsych /tmp/test-task
```

the browser (chrome default) will open and you will see the experiment progress and
finish. The console will show GET and POST of resources, etc.

```

## Survey Robot
The same can be done for a survey! Let's now test bis-11

```
python start.py --robot survey /tmp/bis11-survey
```

The output is similar to jspsych, except we are progressing through a survey.

```
python start.py --robot survey /tmp/bis11-survey

## Singularity Usage
Singularity is ideal for this use case because of the seamless nature between the container and host. We have a pre-built image for your use:

```
singularity pull shub://expfactory/expfactory-robots
```

or if you want to build it yourself, the first thing you would want to do is again clone the repository:

```
git clone https://www.github.com/expfactory/expfactory-robots
cd expfactory-robots
```

and then build.

```
sudo singularity build expfactory-robots.simg Singularity
```

Then to run the image, you will basically want to bind the *parent* folder where your task is to `/data` in the container, and specify the path to the experiment *relative to `data`*

```
singularity run --bind /tmp:/data expfactory-robots.simg /data/test-task
```


## Docker Usage
To build the image:

```
docker build -t expfactory/expfactory-robots .
```

To run it, I again mapped the folder one level above your experiment (so we can validate the experiment folder name itself!) to `/data` in the container, and I also made sure to specify the port, because Docker doesn't have a seamless connection to the host like Singularity.

```bash
PARENT_FOLDER=$(dirname $PWD)
docker run -v $PARENT_FOLDER/:/data -p 3030:3030 expfactory/expfactory-robots /data/test-task
```

If you have issues, you may need to check the version of selenium and the Gecko Driver.
